Has been a long time since my last blog post. A lot of things have changed in the past few years.
Finally I joined the game development industry and I'm working with Unity3D/C#.

Besides, I have a fresh new goal: complete and publish my own game. It's a desolate real time strategy game, set in a sort of a wasteland with scarce resources.
I want explore some different ideas, such as:
* Controlling units: it's heavily inspired by the Close Combat series. The player won't have to manage every single person individually. The units will be a small group of people with a certain degree of autonomy (I really want to avoid micromanagement here);
* Meme-based settlements: every settlement have his unique memepool, which grants custom modifiers, events and behaviours. Every meme can be learned, making every memepool mutable in time. Examples of memes are: corruption, critical thinking, military training, faith and canibalism.
* Huge maps: I mean, really huge maps. 50x50kmÂ² maps, where a person takes a lot of time to cross on foot. Real time strategy games like Age of Empires and StarCraft have small maps where a unit can cross it in just few minutes. Games featuring larger maps (Civilization, Europa Universalis and Total War) don't allow you to see things happening at person level, instead they give you only the "big picture".
* A cruel world: the map is procedurally generated, giving you thousands of different terrains to explore. There's no balanced game start because the world won't care about your special-snow-flake faction. Luck is involved in many actions and people will die because of dumb things.
* Cars: yeah, wasteland and huge maps. You definitely can embark your units in cars. And when your faction have cars a whole new gameplay will emerge.

In the next days I'll be posting more details of the game, with some screenshots and GIFs.
