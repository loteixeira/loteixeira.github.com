## <u>Introduction</u>
[MessagePack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MessagePack) is a specification of a binary data interchange format, similar to [BSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSON) (binary based) and [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) (text based).

According to the offical [website](http://msgpack.org):
> MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. But it's faster and smaller. Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves.

The format was designed to have a small memory footprint, using as few bytes as possible.

## <u>MessagePack for ActionScript3</u>
About one year ago, I worked on a small team which created a panic-board application. The frontend was written in ActionScript3 and the backend in Node.js.<br>
We decided to use MessagePack (instead of the original idea - XML) to create the communication protocol between the client and the server, because our client was wanting a lightweight application to run within his intranet.<br>
At that time, the few implementations of MsgPack for AS3 were too simple, and frankly, quite abandoned.<br>
Then I decided to implement my own version.

## <u>as3-msgpack</u>
Currently, as3-msgpack is shown at [msgpack frontpage](http://msgpack.org) as an implementation for AS3.<br>
The project is [hosted at GitHub](https://github.com/loteixeira/as3-msgpack), licensed under the Apache License.

The usage is quite simple (similar to AS3 JSON encoders, for instance). Your code will work with two methods: read and write - which respectively, decodes and encodes data.

The library was designed to work with the interfaces [IDataInput](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/utils/IDataInput.html) and [IDataOutput](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/utils/IDataOutput.html), so it's easily integrated with ByteArray, Socket, FileStream and URLStream classes.

Example of basic usage:

	// create messagepack object
	var msgpack:MsgPack = new MsgPack();

	// encode an array
	var bytes:ByteArray = msgpack.write([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

	// rewind the buffer
	bytes.position = 0;

	// print the decoded object
	trace(msgpack.read(bytes));

Moreover, as3-msgpack supports stream reading, I mean, you can decode an object using a step-by-step process (useful to work with sockets, for example, where your code doesn't receives all the bytes at the same time).
