<p>Born in 1985 in Pelotas / Brazil, I started programming at 10. I was kind of an apprentice of a friend of my father whose worked as programmer using Clipper and Basic.<br>
Since then I've always studied and worked with code (well, there was a time that I tried to play the guitar - but I suck at it).<br>
Long story short, I went to college to study computer science and later physics and mathematics. I always wanted to work with games and, in my view, a solid technical knowledge was to key to create whatever I invented.<br>
I've worked with Flash and ActionScript during 10 years, most of the time working for the european market. And in the past 4 years I'm working almost exclusivelly with Unity3D making games.<br>
My grand crusade is create my own game, a real time strategy game with some different ideas. And lately I've been working a lot to complete that. And I'll not stop until it's published.</p>
